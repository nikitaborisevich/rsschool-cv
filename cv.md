#### About me
***
Currently I work in a family workshop as a stained glass artist, I am responsible for the full cycle of stained glass production, from the development (creation of a graphic base) of a stained glass window to the production of a finished material product. I have skills in stained glass areas such as: 

* Laid on stained glass.
* Brazed stained glass.
* Faceted stained glass.
* Polymer stained glass.

Initially, he received an education in the specialty software information technology. He stopped moving in this area due to the need to participate in family business.

Why did you decide to change your field of activity? During my work in the field of stained glass production, I have reached the ceiling in development and for a long time I feel like I am trampling on the same level. I want to develop as a specialist as a developer, interest and craving for this field of activity have not faded in me since I studied at the university.

Why am I able to advance in development?
* This type of activity I find extremely exciting for myself.
* I have sufficient perseverance.
* Self-discipline at a high level
* I see prospects for development in the field of programming.
