                Currently I work in a family workshop as a stained glass artist, I am responsible for the full cycle of
                stained glass production, from the development (creation of a graphic base) of a stained glass window to
                the production of a finished material product. I have skills in stained glass areas such as:
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>Laid on stained glass.</li>
                    <li>Brazed stained glass.</li>
                    <li>Faceted stained glass.</li>
                    <li>Polymer stained glass.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="text__indent">Initially, he received an education in the specialty software information
                    technology. He stopped moving
                    in this area due to the need to participate in family business.</p>

                <p class="text__indent">Why did you decide to change your field of activity? During my work in the field
                    of stained glass
                    production, I have reached the ceiling in development and for a long time I feel like I am trampling
                    on
                    the same level. I want to develop as a specialist as a developer, interest and craving for this
                    field of
                    activity have not faded in me since I studied at the university.p</p>

                <p class="text__indent">Why am I able to advance in development?</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>This type of activity I find extremely exciting for myself.</li>
                    <li>I have sufficient perseverance.</li>
                    <li>Self-discipline at a high level</li>
                    <li>I see prospects for development in the field of programming.</li>
